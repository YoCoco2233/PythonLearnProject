"""
In python, a for loop is used to iterate over elements of a sequence,
such as a list,tuple,dictionary,set,or string.
The basic principle of a for loop is to iterate over the elements of a sequence.

During each iteration, the loop variable is assigned the value of its index,
and the code block within the loop is executed.
This process continue until all the elements in the sequence have been processed.

The for loop provides a convenient way to perform repeated operations of items
without the need for explicit indexing or counting.

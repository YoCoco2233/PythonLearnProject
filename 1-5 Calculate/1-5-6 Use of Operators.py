"""
Addition Operator (+): Described as adding, with an example of 1+1 resulting in 2.
Subtraction Operator (-): Described as subtracting, with an example of 1-1 resulting in 0.
Multiplication Operator (): Described as multiplying, with an example of 22 resulting in 4.
Bit Shift Operator (Shift +8): Typically used in binary operations, but the specific example is not given here.
Division Operator (/): Described as dividing, but the example of 10/2 resulting in 5 is inaccurate. The actual result should be 5 with a remainder of 0, or simply 5 (depending on the context whether the remainder is considered).
Integer Division Operator (Left Slash): Described as performing integer division, taking only the quotient, with an example of 9/4 resulting in 2.
Modulus Operator (%): Described as taking the remainder, with an example of 9%4 resulting in 2.
Exponentiation Operator (): Described as raising to a power, with an example of 24 resulting in 16, which is 2 multiplied by itself 3 times.
Parentheses: Described as enhancing the order of operations, with an example of (1+2)*3 resulting 9
